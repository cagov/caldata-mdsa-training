# Overview

CalData's Modern Data Stack training was born from our team's service called the Modern Data Stack Accelerator (MDSA). The service is a practical approach to help departments rapidly adopt modern cloud-based data tools while working on a data challenge they want to solve. In a nutshell the MDSA helps empower teams to use modern data tools effectively by demystifying what building a modern data stack means, including:

- architecting and procuring data stack components,
- creating a culture of data operations across a team,
- developing repeatable, automated, and observable processes, and
- staffing to maintain a modern data stack.

The accelerator starts with a real business problem where supporting data has traditionally been difficult to combine and/or clean up. Using modern data tools in ODI's environment, combined with training and consultation, teams learn how to transform and automate this process. The goal of the service is to build a team's capacity to use the modern data stack and be ready to move from demonstration to production. You can read more about the service on [our team's site](https://docs.data.ca.gov/odi-data-services-dif/modern-data-stack-accelerator).

As we have now successfully trained several state departments on this service, this website serves as our attempt to open source our resources. We hope this enables anyone -- regardless of what tools they have in their stack -- to learn data and analytics engineering concepts and skills.
